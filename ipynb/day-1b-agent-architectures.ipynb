Running them in sequence would be slow and inefficient, creating a bottleneck where each task waits unnecessarily.\n\n**The Solution: Concurrent Execution**\n\nWhen you have independent tasks, you can run them all at the same time using a `ParallelAgent`. This agent executes all of its sub-agents concurrently, dramatically speeding up the workflow. Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.\n\n**Use Parallel when:** Tasks are independent, speed matters, and you can execute concurrently.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [parallel agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Multi-Topic Research**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"User Request: Research 3 topics\"] -- > B[\"Parallel Execution\"]\n    B -- > C[\"Tech Researcher\"]\n    B -- > D[\"Health Researcher\"]\n    B -- > E[\"Finance Researcher\"]\n\n    C -- > F[\"Aggregator\"]\n    D -- > F\n    E -- > F\n    F -- > G[\"Combined Report\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffffcc\n    style F fill:#ffccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/parallel-agent.png\" alt=\"Parallel Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.1 Example: Parallel Multi-Topic Research\n\nLet's build a system with four agents:\n\n1. **Tech Researcher** - Researches AI/ML news and trends\n2. **Health Researcher** - Researches recent medical news and trends\n3. **Finance Researcher** - Researches finance and fintech news and trends\n4. **Aggregator Agent** - Combines all research findings into a single summary","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Tech Researcher: Focuses on AI and ML trends.\ntech_researcher = Agent(\n    name=\"TechResearcher\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Research the latest AI/ML trends.

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-12T19:21:19.549881Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-12T19:21:19.550670Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-12T19:21:19.557253Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-12T19:21:19.550632Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-12T19:21:19.556074Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":38},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

A fearsome beast, the vacuum cleaner, roared its displeasure from the corner. His mama had gone to the kitchen, leaving him alone with the growling monster. Leo’s lip trembled, but only for a second. He was Leo, after all. He remembered Papa’s lesson: “Brave boys don’t run, they think!” Leo tiptoed past the roaring giant, his eyes fixed on the prize: the shiny red ball just out of reach. He grabbed a fluffy pillow, a shield against the noise, and crept closer. With a mighty, silent lunge, he snatched the ball. Victory! He held it aloft, a conqueror, just as Mama reappeared. Leo beamed, his mission accomplished, his bravery rewarded.\nCriticAgent > The story is charming and effectively captures a child's perspective.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, Leo's Bravery and Smartness:** While the story states Leo is brave and smart, consider showing these traits more explicitly through his actions and internal thoughts. For instance, instead of just saying he remembered Papa's lesson, you could briefly show him *thinking* about it. How does he interpret \"think\"? Perhaps he observes the vacuum's pattern or notices a way to approach it indirectly.\n\n2.  **Enhance the \"Fearsome Beast\" Metaphor:** The vacuum cleaner as a beast is a great starting point. You could expand on this with more sensory details from Leo's perspective. What does the \"roaring displeasure\" *sound* like to him? Does it have \"eyes\" or \"teeth\"? This would further immerse the reader in his child-like view of the world.\n\n3.  **Consider a Moment of Near-Failure or a More Complex Solution:** To truly highlight his intelligence and bravery, Leo could encounter a small obstacle that requires a more intricate solution than simply grabbing the ball. Perhaps the ball is just slightly too far, or the vacuum moves, forcing him to adapt his plan. This would make his ultimate success feel even more earned.\nRefinerAgent > Leo, all of three years and a magnificent mop of curls, surveyed his domain: the living room. A fearsome beast, the vacuum cleaner, roared its displeasure from the corner. Its single, unblinking eye seemed to follow him, and its gaping maw, a dark cavern, promised a terrible fate for any who dared approach. Its unhappy growl vibrated through the floor, a monster’s gut-rumble. Mama had gone to the kitchen, leaving him alone with the growling titan. Leo’s lip trembled, a tiny tremor quickly suppressed. He was Leo.\n\nPapa’s words echoed in his mind, not as a stern command, but as a puzzle: “Brave boys don’t run, they *think*!” Think? Leo’s eyes darted between the beast and his prize, the shiny red ball, nestled just beyond the monster’s hungry reach. The beast hummed, its long, snaking tail twitching. It only seemed to roar when it moved forward. If he waited… Leo’s gaze fell upon a mountain range of cushions. An idea sparked. He grabbed a particularly fluffy one, a shield of softness against the world’s loud noises.\n\nHe didn't tiptoe; that was for mice. Leo stalked, low and deliberate, like the jungle explorers in his books. He used the cushion as a temporary barrier, peeking around its edges. The beast remained still, its eye fixed on the far wall. Now! He saw a clear path, not directly at the ball, but at an angle, using the sofa as cover. He darted from the cushion-fortress to the sofa’s edge, his heart thumping like a tiny drum. The ball was *so close*. He stretched, his fingers brushing the cool plastic. The beast, perhaps sensing his intent, let out a sudden, louder GRRROWL and shifted slightly, its snout nudging closer to the ball.\n\nLeo froze. His shield was too small. His direct approach was blocked. Think! He looked at the sofa, then at the ball, then at the beast’s twitching tail. He couldn't reach it. But… he could *prod* it. Using the corner of his cushion-shield, Leo subtly, carefully, nudged the red ball. It rolled, a glorious, silent escape, just out of the beast’s immediate vicinity. Leo, quick as a shadow, scooped it up. Victory! He held it aloft, a conqueror beaming, just as Mama reappeared. Leo, the brave and the clever, had tamed the beast.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
